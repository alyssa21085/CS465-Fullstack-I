Architecture 

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). 

The different types of frontend development have different advantages to each of them. The singe page application is great for quickly rendering changes and has fast load times to be able to quickly perceive changes made. It has a mobile application feel to the program, the SPA is used for admin purposes to ensure that functions are working properly. Express HTML is a server-side application that renders a full HTML page, each interaction with the program causes a full page reload so it is not ideal for load times however, is able to display a lot of detailed information needed by customers. The JavaScript is used to be able to accurately fetch data from databases to render information on client side to successfully display information as well as give the page functionality. 

 

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database? 

The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database due to it being able to handle diverse data while being easily scalable for the ability to handle a multitude of data across different servers if needed.  

 

 

 

Functionality 

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? 

JavaScript is a programming language whereas JSON is a data format. JSON is able to tie the front end and back end together by being the data format that each end can understand.  

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components. 

Creating the trip cards was created to improve functionality, the trip card component is able to pull data from the trip list component creating individual trip cards. Were the UI of the trip cards is able to be reused for different trip data within the trip lists. This is able to make the development process faster with loading times of the same UI but able to display a variety of data. 

 

 

Testing 

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application. 

When testing different methods and endpoints like PUT, POST and GET methods one is able to test with reloading webpages to ensure that the functionality has been implemented successfully. However, Postman is also able to be used to test these functionalities as well to ensure the proper functionality while maintaining security. 

Reflection 

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field? 

 

This course has helped me immensely in terms of understanding the architecture of fullstack programs and has helped me better understand the differences of frontend and backend development. I believe that the this has furthered my understanding on how databases are linked to certain programs as well as the data that is able to be pulled from them and how they interact with one another.
